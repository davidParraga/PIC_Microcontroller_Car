# Description of the project

PICaR consists of a small vehicle, built with Meccano parts and two DC motors, and a remote control. 
The vehicle controller board and the remote control are based on the PIC16F876A microcontroller. 
The objective of this project is to program both microcontrollers to provide PICaRC with the functionality to control 
the direction and speed of the vehicle remotely by a user using the remote control
